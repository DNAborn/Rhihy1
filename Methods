Data Acquisition and Processing

Raw sequencing data were obtained from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession number SRP350860.  Reads were mapped to the Rhizoctonia hymenis  genome and EST sequences, downloaded from MycoCosm (https://mycocosm.jgi.doe.gov/Rhihy1/Rhihy1.home.html), using Salmon (v1.10.3). A decoy-aware index was constructed using both the reference transcriptome and genome. Salmon quantification was performed with the --validateMappings and --gcBias options.

Differential Gene Expression Analysis

Transcript-level quantifications were imported for differential expression analysis using tximport (v1.32.0).  Differential gene expression analysis was conducted with DESeq2 (v1.44.0) in R. Normalized count data were subsequently exported and visualized.
